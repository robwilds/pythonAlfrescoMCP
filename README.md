# This project was created using this as a guide: https://medium.com/data-engineering-with-dremio/building-a-basic-mcp-server-with-python-4c34c41031ed

## note: instead of using uv as package manager, I used pip

# There's an MCP.json file for use with copilot in vscode that uses an absolute path to the main.py file. You will have to modify this absolute path for your system unless your have my exact username syntax :)
